# Hand_Gesture_Computer_Control
This is a project I built using google's mediapipeline and the hand-landmarker model. It is designed to allow me to play games by just moving my hands. It requires a webcam or camera plugged in and turned on to your PC.

Required libraries: (install using py -m pip install (library name))
-mediapipeline
-cv2 (open cv)
-pyautogui
-pydirectinput
-pydirectinput-rgx
