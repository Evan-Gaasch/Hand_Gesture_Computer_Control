# Hand_Gesture_Computer_Control
This is a project I built using google's mediapipeline and the hand-landmarker model. It is designed to allow me to play games by just moving my hands. It requires a webcam or camera plugged in and turned on to your PC. This code is purely experimental and can be laggy at times. Please note that there are two modes: game mode and normal mode. Game mode is a bit more unstable but allows for the use of this system to control games, while normal mode cannot control most games but is slightly more stable.

Future updates will include adding a UI and building a fully packaged app, decreasing lag, tuning the controls, and testing on different devices.
