# Hand_Gesture_Computer_Control
This is a project I built using google's mediapipeline and the hand-landmarker model. It is designed to allow me to play games by just moving my hands. It requires a webcam or camera plugged in and turned on to your PC. This code is purely experimental and can be laggy at times.
